Instructions for how to compile and run the software:

1.	Create a new project choose Console App (.Net Framework) then click NEXT.
 
2.	Label the project however you wish to and once you done click CREATE.
 
3.	 After you click create you be on a screen like this where you start creating your code that you wish to execute

4.	Once you are satisfied with your code, click the start button to test it. If there are any errors, the system will indicate their locations and provide guidance on how to fix them, helping you achieve a successful compilation..

5.	This is the welcome screen for my project. Users need to click 'Enter' to access the app.

6.	After the user clicks 'Enter', they will be directed to this screen, where they can execute any of the six available menu items.

7.	When you click on option 1, you can enter a recipe name and an unlimited number of ingredients. Follow the prompts displayed on the screen, and then select the food group for each ingredient from the list provided.

8.	If an ingredient is not listed under a food group, you can type '7' to create a custom food group. After that, enter the steps for your recipe and click 'Enter' when you are finished.

9.	If you have entered all the details correctly, you will be brought back to this screen, where you can view, scale, remove, or edit the recipe you created.
 
10.	When you select option 2, you will see a menu displaying all the recipes you have entered. To view a recipe, type the number next to it. Recipes are listed in alphabetical order for easy access.

11.	After you choose the number of the recipe you want to view, you will see all the details you previously submitted. Additionally, I have added a special feature for recipes under 100 calories.

12.	If the recipe has between 100-300 calories, it will display a message informing the user of this range.

13.	If the recipe exceeds 300 calories, a message will be displayed, warning the user that they have surpassed the specified calorie limit.

14.	Typing 3 allows you to scale the recipes you have entered.

15.	You can scale the recipe down by 0.5 or up by 2 or 3. Not only will the ingredients be adjusted accordingly, but the calories will also scale accordingly based on your selection.
 

16.	You can scale the recipe as many times as you like by selecting "Yes" to indicate you want to scale, and then confirming again to bring up the scale options. If you're finished scaling, type "No" when prompted, and you will return to the main menu.

17.	Selecting option 4 allows you to remove a recipe. Simply enter the number next to the recipe you wish to remove, and the system will take care of the rest for you.

18.	“Press any key to continue.”
 
19.	If you type 2 to view your recipes, you will notice that the recipe you deleted will no longer be listed.

20.	If you type 5, you'll be able to edit a recipe you've previously entered. Follow the same instructions as in Step 7, and once you're finished, the recipe will be updated with the changes you made. When you type 2 to view your recipes, you'll see the updated data.
 

21.	When you're ready to leave the app, simply type 6, and you'll receive our goodbye screen. After that, you'll successfully exit the app.

A brief description (100 to 200 words) of what you changed based on your lecturer’s feedback. 
	
Please find below the changes that was asked from me:
The program does not compile after attempting to scale the quantities. Therefore, the rest of the program cannot be tested. Marks capped. OOP constructs did not implement the code structure is poor. Add appropriate spacing and dividers. Rather put in-line comments on new lines (you also don't need to comment on every single line)
Please find below the changes that was made according to what you asked as well as extra to make part 1 better:
•	Fixed the compilation issue when scaling quantities.
•	Implemented better object-oriented programming (OOP) constructs.
•	Improved the code structure with appropriate spacing and dividers.
•	Moved in-line comments to new lines for clarity and reduced unnecessary comments.
Summary of Changes:
1.	Resolved Compilation Issue: Addressed the string manipulation within the ScaleRecipe () function, ensuring the ingredient strings are updated correctly.
2.	Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Enhancements: Implemented class encapsulation for Recipe and RecipeApp, refining method definitions and class utilization to adhere more closely to OOP principles.
3.	Code Refactoring: Introduced spacing between methods and logical code segments, relocated in-line comments to separate lines for enhanced readability, and minimized excessive commentary.
4.	Input Validation Improvements: Strengthened input validation for the scaling factor to safeguard against program crashes.
5.	Scaling with Original Quantities: Modified the ScaleRecipe method to consistently utilize originalQuantities as the foundation for scaling.
6.	Class Structure Optimization: Reorganized class fields and methods to improve readability and optimize the application of OOP principles.
7.	Comment Optimization: Removed inline comments to enhance code readability and retained comments only where necessary for clarity.
8.	User Input Validation Enhancements: Advanced user input validation methods, including ReadInt, ReadDouble, and ReadString, to ensure robustness and reliability.
