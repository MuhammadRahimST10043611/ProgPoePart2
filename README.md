A brief description (100 to 200 words) of what you changed based on your lecturer’s feedback. 
	
Please find below the changes that were asked from me:
The program does not compile after attempting to scale the quantities. Therefore, the rest of the program cannot be tested. Marks capped. OOP constructs did not implement the code structure is poor. Add appropriate spacing and dividers. Rather put in-line comments on new lines (you also don't need to comment on every single line)
Please find below the changes that were made according to what you asked as well as extra to make part 1 better:
•	Fixed the compilation issue when scaling quantities.
•	Implemented better object-oriented programming (OOP) constructs.
•	Improved the code structure with appropriate spacing and dividers.
•	Moved in-line comments to new lines for clarity and reduced unnecessary comments.
Summary of Changes:
1.	Resolved Compilation Issue: Addressed the string manipulation within the ScaleRecipe () function, ensuring the ingredient strings are updated correctly.
2.	Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Enhancements: Implemented class encapsulation for Recipe and RecipeApp, refining method definitions and class utilization to adhere more closely to OOP principles.
3.	Code Refactoring: Introduced spacing between methods and logical code segments, relocated in-line comments to separate lines for enhanced readability, and minimized excessive commentary.
4.	Input Validation Improvements: Strengthened input validation for the scaling factor to safeguard against program crashes.
5.	Scaling with Original Quantities: Modified the ScaleRecipe method to consistently utilize originalQuantities as the foundation for scaling.
6.	Class Structure Optimization: Reorganized class fields and methods to improve readability and optimize the application of OOP principles.
7.	Comment Optimization: Removed inline comments to enhance code readability and retained comments only where necessary for clarity.
8.	User Input Validation Enhancements: Advanced user input validation methods, including ReadInt, ReadDouble, and ReadString, to ensure robustness and reliability.
